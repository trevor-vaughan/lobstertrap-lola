## Context

[ADR: Extension Architecture](extension-architecture.md) establishes that
any developer can add targets, sources, and catalogs without forking Lola. That
is the goal. It also means Lola will execute third-party code on developer
workstations and in CI, during `lola install`.

That code runs as an ordinary subprocess owned by the invoking user, under both
the accepted design and the proposed one. The extension architecture ADR
specifies that external extensions run as separate processes and gives the
reason as "protecting core stability". The provider architecture proposed in
#221 runs them through `hashicorp/go-plugin`, which describes its own isolation
as:

> Plugins can be relatively secure: The plugin only has access to the interfaces
> and args given to it, **not to the entire memory space of the process**.

That is memory isolation between host and plugin: it prevents a plugin crash
from taking down the host. It is not privilege isolation. A subprocess extension
can read `~/.ssh`, write `~/.bashrc`, and open outbound network connections,
because it runs as the user. The provider architecture design compounds this by
specifying provider-owned filesystem writes.

Shipped code has the same shape. Issue #42 records that pre- and post-install
hooks execute automatically, with the user's permissions and without a consent
prompt, and asks for a warning and a confirmation before each one. A prompt is
worth having. It also asks the person least able to answer it, at the moment
they want the install to finish, about a script they have not read. Bounding
what the script can reach is the part a prompt cannot do.

The proposed sigstore integration ADR supplies *provenance* — who published this
artifact. *Confinement* — what the artifact may do once running — is a separate
axis. That ADR covers the first; this ADR proposes the second.

Extension authors must be able to use **Python, JavaScript, Go, and Rust**.

## Decision

Confinement comes from two layers, in priority order.

### 1. Effects are host-mediated (primary guarantee)

Extensions do not write files or open sockets. An extension receives input and
returns a **plan**, a declarative description of the effects it wants. The host
validates the plan against the extension's granted capabilities and performs the
effects itself.

This puts path validation, dry-run, atomic rollback, conflict detection, and
audit logging in one place in the host, where they are written once and apply to
every extension in every language and every tier.

### 2. Execution is tiered

| Tier               | Mechanism                                                                     | Languages             | Trust                                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1 — WASM**       | `.wasm` module, WASI preview 1, run by wazero inside a self-exec shim process | Go, Rust, JavaScript  | Default. Capability-confined by the runtime. |
| **2 — Subprocess** | Ordinary process speaking the same plan protocol over a pipe                  | Any, including Python | Opt-in per extension, signature required.    |

Tier 1 is the default and the documented path. Tier 2 exists because Python
cannot be compiled to WASI preview 1 without shipping a CPython interpreter, and
Python is a required language. A tier-2 extension is still bound by the
host-mediated interface: it receives input on stdin and returns a plan on
stdout, and is granted no filesystem or network capability. Its additional risk
is that nothing *enforces* that at the OS level.

Installing a tier-2 extension requires an explicit opt-in and a valid signature.
Lola reports the tier of every installed extension in `lola ext ls`.

### 3. The shim is a self-exec

The host re-executes its own binary as a hidden `lola __extension-host`
subcommand. The child applies OS-level confinement, instantiates the WASM module
through wazero with only the granted capabilities, and communicates with the
parent over a pipe.

Self-exec rather than a separate runner binary keeps Lola a single static
artifact, which is the primary rationale of [ADR: Go
Migration](go-migration.md). Process isolation and capability isolation stack: a
wazero bug does not immediately become host compromise, and the child can be
resource-limited by the OS.

On Linux the child also applies Landlock. This is defense in depth, not the
guarantee — Landlock is unavailable on macOS and Windows, and the design must be
safe without it.

### 4. Capabilities are declared and granted, never assumed

An extension declares required capabilities in its manifest. The host grants the
narrowest set that satisfies the declaration, and denies by default. A target
extension that declares no capabilities (the expected case, since it returns a
write plan) runs with none.

Credentials are held by the host and never handed to an extension. Issue #175
asks for authenticated HTTP cloning of private repositories. Under a plan, the
extension emits a `clone` intent naming the remote, and the host attaches
whatever credential it holds for that remote. A source extension therefore never
sees a token, which removes the question of whether it can be trusted with one.

## Rationale

- **The interface carries more weight than the sandbox.** A pure extension that
  describes its effects is safe in any tier. An effectful extension needs a
  perfect sandbox forever. Choosing the second is picking the harder problem.
- **wazero is the only viable embedded runtime.** It is pure Go with no cgo,
  which preserves the single static binary and one-step cross-compilation that
  motivated the Go migration. `wasmtime-go` requires cgo and supports only
  Linux/macOS/Windows on x86_64 — no Apple Silicon.
- **Confinement and provenance are complementary.** Signing tells you who wrote
  an extension; sandboxing bounds what it can do when the signer is wrong or
  compromised.
- **`lola install` runs in CI.** CI holds credentials and runs unattended, so an
  unconfined extension has both the most to reach and the least chance of being
  noticed.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- A malicious tier-1 extension cannot read `~/.ssh` or reach the network,
  regardless of what its code attempts
- Path validation, dry-run, and rollback are implemented once in the host rather
  than correctly-or-otherwise in every extension
- `.wasm` modules are single content-addressable artifacts, which fits the
  `lola.sum` hashing proposed in the module package format ADR, and sigstore
  bundle signing, directly
- Dry-run (`--dry-run`) becomes trivial: execute the extension, print the plan,
  do not apply
- Extension crashes and infinite loops are contained by the shim process

### Negative Consequences

- Extension authors must target WASI preview 1 rather than writing a native
  binary, which is a real ergonomic cost relative to a drop-in script
- Python extensions get weaker enforcement than the other three languages — an
  asymmetry that must be documented honestly rather than glossed
- The plan protocol must express every effect an extension needs; an effect the
  protocol cannot describe forces an extension into tier 2
- Templating has to be placed deliberately. Issue #195 asks for inline
  templating, and template expansion is evaluation, so the protocol must say
  whether it happens inside the extension or in the host. If a plan can carry an
  unexpanded template, then expanded output reaching a path field is
  attacker-influenced input, and host-side path validation has to run after
  expansion rather than before it
- Two execution paths mean two code paths in the host and two sets of
  integration tests
- WASI preview 1 has no standard interface-type story, so the ABI is Lola's to
  define and version
- The self-exec shim adds process-spawn latency to every extension invocation

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Unsandboxed subprocess only
- Description: extensions are ordinary binaries; security rests on signing. This
  is the status quo of both the extension architecture and provider architecture
  proposals.
- Pros: any language including shell; simplest possible authoring; no ABI to
  define
- Cons: no confinement whatsoever; a compromised signing identity or a malicious
  extension in a marketplace has full user privileges, including in CI
- Reason for rejection: provenance without confinement is a single point of
  failure. This remains available as tier 2 for cases that need it, with opt-in
  and signing.

### Alternative 2: WebAssembly Component Model (WASI 0.2)
- Description: target WASI 0.2 with WIT interfaces; first-class Python via
  `componentize-py` and JavaScript via ComponentizeJS
- Pros: typed interfaces with generated bindings; Python is first-class rather
  than an exception; the direction the ecosystem is moving
- Cons: no pure-Go runtime implements it. Reaching it requires `wasmtime-go`
  (cgo, x86_64-only) or shipping a second non-Go runner binary, forfeiting the
  single-binary property
- Reason for rejection: deferred, not rejected on merit. Revisit when a pure-Go
  component-model runtime exists; the plan protocol should not obstruct that
  migration.

### Alternative 3: Extism
- Description: an established plugin framework built on wazero, with PDKs for
  several languages
- Pros: solves memory management and host functions; proven pattern; avoids
  defining an ABI
- Cons: no Python PDK, which fails a stated requirement. Separately,
  `extism/go-sdk` — the exact component Lola would depend on — was last updated
  2025-05-14
- Reason for rejection: fails the language requirement, with a maintenance
  concern on the specific dependency as a second reason

### Alternative 4: OCI containers per extension
- Description: each extension is a container image, executed by a container
  runtime
- Pros: strong isolation; any language; familiar packaging
- Cons: requires a container runtime on every user's machine and in CI; startup
  cost; poor fit for a tool whose selling point is a single static binary
- Reason for rejection: contradicts the distribution model established by the Go
  migration

### Alternative 5: Subprocess plus OS sandboxing only
- Description: keep native binaries, confine with Landlock, `sandbox-exec`, and
  AppContainer
- Pros: any language including shell, with real confinement on Linux
- Cons: three separate platform implementations with materially different
  guarantees; the macOS and Windows stories are substantially weaker; nothing is
  portable
- Reason for rejection: the guarantee would vary by platform, which is the
  hardest kind of security property to document or reason about. Retained as a
  hardening layer on Linux.

## Implementation Notes

- Prerequisites: [ADR: Go Migration](go-migration.md), [ADR: Extension
  Architecture](extension-architecture.md)
- Paired design: [Extension Sandboxing
  design](../dev-guide/design/extension-sandboxing.md)
- New dependencies, vetted and approved:
  - `github.com/tetratelabs/wazero` v1.12.0 — Apache-2.0, zero transitive
    dependencies, 81 contributors, last release 2026-05-29
  - `github.com/landlock-lsm/go-landlock` v0.10.0 — MIT, Linux-only hardening.
    Single-maintainer risk accepted: the API surface is small, the layer is
    strictly additive, and abandonment means dropping the layer rather than a
    rewrite.
- This ADR constrains but does not decide the extension transport. It is
  compatible with either the stdin/stdout protocol or a gRPC provider model,
  because the plan protocol is a payload shape rather than a transport.
  Whichever transport is chosen must carry plans rather than granting effects.
- The Go project structure ADR (in review as #111) gains an
  `internal/extensions/host/` package for the shim. `pkg/sdk/` gains the plan
  types, which are part of the public contract.
