# Lola - AI Context Package Manager

**Write Agent Skills and Contexts once, use everywhere.**

Lola is a universal AI Package Manager. If an agent's skills were an RPM, Lola is the DNF for it. Write your [skills and context modules](https://lobstertrap.org/lola/concepts/skills-and-modules/) once as portable packages, then install them to any AI assistant or agent with a single command.

### Official Lola Marketplace

We maintain an official, community-driven marketplace with curated modules at [github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market).

**Quick setup:**
```bash
lola market add general https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/main/general-market.yml
```

This gives you instant access to community modules like workflow automation, code quality tools, and more. **We highly encourage you to:**
- Use modules from the official marketplace
- Contribute your own modules
- Share feedback and improvements

All contributions are welcome! See the [marketplace contributing guide](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Register a marketplace

```bash
# Add a marketplace from a URL
lola market add general https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/main/general-market.yml

# List registered marketplaces
lola market ls
```

### Search and install from marketplace

```bash
# Search across all enabled marketplaces
lola mod search authentication

# Install directly from marketplace (auto-adds and installs)
lola install git-workflow -a claude-code
```

When a module exists in multiple marketplaces, Lola prompts you to select which one to use.

### Manage marketplaces

```bash
# Update marketplace cache
lola market update general

# Update all marketplaces
lola market update

# Disable a marketplace (keeps it registered but excludes from search)
lola market set --disable general

# Re-enable a marketplace
lola market set --enable general

# Remove a marketplace
lola market rm general
```

### Marketplace YAML format

Create your own marketplace by hosting a YAML file with this structure:

```yaml

modules:
  - name: git-workflow
    description: Git workflow automation skills
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: https://github.com/user/git-workflow.git
    tags: [git, workflow]

    description: Code review assistant skills
    version: 1.2.0
    repository: https://github.com/user/code-review.git
    tags: [review, quality]
```

**Fields:**
- `name`: Marketplace display name
- `description`: What this marketplace provides
- `version`: Marketplace schema version
- `modules`: List of available modules
  - `name`: Module name (must match repository directory name)
  - `description`: Brief description shown in search results

## Creating a Module

### 1. Initialize

```bash
lola mod init my-skills
cd my-skills
```

This creates:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md         # Initial skill (unless --no-skill)
  commands/            # Created by default
    example-command.md # (unless --no-command)
  agents/              # Created by default
    example-agent.md   # (unless --no-agent)
```

### 2. Edit the skill

Edit `skills/example-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skills
description: Description shown in skill listings
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI assistant...
```

### 3. Add supporting files to skills

You can add additional files to any skill directory (scripts, templates, examples, etc.). Reference them using relative paths in your `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
# My Skill

Use the helper script: `./scripts/helper.sh`

Load the template from: `./templates/example.md`
```

**Path handling:** Use relative paths like `./file` or `./scripts/helper.sh` to reference files in the same skill directory. Each assistant handles these differently:

| Assistant | Skill Location | Supporting Files | Path Behavior |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | Copied with skill | Paths work as-is |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/<skill>.mdc` | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths rewritten automatically |
| Gemini | `GEMINI.md` (references only) | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths work (SKILL.md read from source) |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` (references only) | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths work (SKILL.md read from source) |

- **Claude Code** copies the entire skill directory, so relative paths like `./scripts/helper.sh` work because the files are alongside `SKILL.md`
- **Cursor** only copies the skill content to an `.mdc` file, so Lola rewrites `./` paths to point back to `.lola/modules/<module>/skills/<skill>/`
- **Gemini/OpenCode** don't copy skills—they add entries to `GEMINI.md`/`AGENTS.md` that tell the AI to read the original `SKILL.md` from `.lola/modules/`, so relative paths work from that location

Example skill structure:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
      scripts/
        helper.sh
      templates/
        example.md
```

### 4. Add more skills

Create additional skill directories under `skills/`, each with a `SKILL.md`:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
    git-workflow/
      SKILL.md
    code-review/
      SKILL.md
```

### 5. Add slash commands

Create a `commands/` directory with markdown files:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
  commands/
    review-pr.md
    quick-commit.md
```

Command files use YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Review a pull request
argument-hint: <pr-number>
---

Review PR #$ARGUMENTS and provide feedback.
```

> **Note:** Modules use auto-discovery. Skills, commands, and agents are automatically detected from the directory structure. No manifest file is required.

### 6. Add to registry and install

```bash
lola mod add ./my-skills
lola install my-skills
```

## Module Structure

```
my-module/
  skills/            # Skills directory
    skill-name/
      SKILL.md       # Required: skill definition
      scripts/       # Optional: supporting files
      templates/     # Optional: templates
  commands/          # Optional: slash commands
    review-pr.md
    quick-commit.md
  agents/            # Optional: subagents
    my-agent.md
```

> **Note:** Modules use auto-discovery. Skills are discovered from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, commands from `commands/*.md`, and agents from `agents/*.md`. No manifest file is required.

### SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill
---

# Skill Title

Your instructions, workflows, and guidance for the AI assistant.

Reference supporting files using relative paths:
- `./scripts/helper.sh` - files in the same skill directory
- `./templates/example.md` - subdirectories are supported
```

**Supporting files:** You can include scripts, templates, examples, or any other files in your skill directory. Use relative paths like `./file` or `./scripts/helper.sh` in your `SKILL.md` to reference them. These paths are automatically rewritten for different assistant types during installation.

### Command Files

```markdown
---
description: What this command does
argument-hint: <required> [optional]
---

Your prompt template here. Use $ARGUMENTS for all args or $1, $2 for positional.
```

**Argument variables:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All arguments as a single string
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`... - Positional arguments

Commands are automatically converted to each assistant's format:
- Claude/Cursor: Markdown with frontmatter (pass-through)
- Gemini: TOML with `{{args}}` substitution

## How It Works

1. **Marketplaces**: Register catalogs at `~/.lola/market/` with cached data at `~/.lola/market/cache/`
2. **Discovery**: Search across enabled marketplace caches to find modules
3. **Registry**: Modules are stored in `~/.lola/modules/`
4. **Installation**: Skills and commands are converted to each assistant's native format
5. **Prefixing**: Skills and commands are prefixed with module name to avoid conflicts (e.g., `mymodule-skill`)
6. **Project scope**: Copies modules to `.lola/modules/` within the project
7. **Updates**: `lola mod update` re-fetches from original source; `lola update` regenerates files; `lola market update` refreshes marketplace caches
